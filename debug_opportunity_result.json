However, looking at the summarized data [...] In SF, several different bone graft procedures amount to a total of nearly 2.2 million of these operations worldwide, with autograft as the gold standard [45]. Autograft from the iliac crest has a fusion rate of 90% and shows osteogenic, osteoinductive and osteoconductive abilities. However, due to some limitations in the use of autografts, such as donor site pain, wound infection, hematoma, pseudoarthrosis, bleeding and subsidence, other grafts (natural or synthetic) started to be used as [...] percentages of subsidence and pseudoarthrosis. Most studies highlighted the role of surgical techniques in patient complications. There are many interacting events that contextually affect the rate of clinical success or failure.

Moreover, the use of bone substitutes and biological adjuvants is difficult to standardize because it often depends on the clinical needs that become evident during surgery.
