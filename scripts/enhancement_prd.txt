# Medical Device Intelligence Platform Enhancement PRD

## Project Overview
Transform the current orthopedic-focused competitive intelligence platform into a comprehensive medical device manufacturing intelligence platform with enhanced source transparency and drill-down capabilities.

## Current State
- Platform currently branded as "orthopedic intelligence"
- Successfully analyzes competitors across multiple medical device categories (cardiovascular, diabetes care, joint replacement, spine)
- Generates 15-20 strategic opportunities per analysis
- Uses Tavily for research but sources are not visible to end users
- Deployed locally, needs production deployment capability

## Enhancement Goals

### 1. Medical Device Manufacturing Rebranding
**Objective**: Rebrand from orthopedic-specific to comprehensive medical device manufacturing platform

**Requirements**:
- Update all UI text, titles, and branding from "orthopedic" to "medical device manufacturing"
- Modify welcome messages and descriptions to reflect broader scope
- Update example companies to showcase variety across device categories
- Ensure branding appeals to marketing firms serving diverse medical device clients
- Maintain professional, executive-ready appearance

### 2. Source Detail Drill-Down Feature
**Objective**: Provide transparency and credibility by allowing users to examine the research sources behind opportunities

**Requirements**:
- Display source URLs and titles for each opportunity generated
- Allow users to click through to original Tavily research results
- Show research confidence scores and source quality indicators
- Provide expandable sections for detailed source information
- Maintain clean UI while adding source transparency
- Enable users to validate and verify opportunity recommendations

### 3. Production Deployment Preparation
**Objective**: Prepare platform for production deployment and external user access

**Requirements**:
- Ensure proper branch management (avoid pushing to main)
- Create deployment-ready configuration
- Test all features work in production environment
- Verify external access capabilities
- Document deployment process

## Target Users
- Marketing firms serving medical device manufacturers
- Strategy consultants in healthcare/medical device space
- Business development teams at medical device companies
- Competitive intelligence professionals

## Success Criteria
- Platform successfully rebranded to medical device manufacturing focus
- Users can drill down into source details for any opportunity
- Platform ready for external user access and demo
- All existing functionality preserved during enhancements
- Professional appearance maintained throughout

## Technical Considerations
- Maintain existing LangGraph backend functionality
- Preserve opportunity generation quality and speed
- Ensure source data is properly captured and stored
- Implement clean UI patterns for source detail display
- Test across all medical device categories

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Planning and task creation
- Phase 2: Rebranding implementation
- Phase 3: Source drill-down feature development
- Phase 4: Production deployment preparation
- Phase 5: Testing and validation
