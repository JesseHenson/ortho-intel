# üîç Tavily Optimization Deep Dive Plan
## Improving Medical Device Competitive Intelligence Research

### üéØ Objective
Transform the Tavily search strategy to consistently generate high-quality opportunities across all medical device categories, ensuring robust results for any manufacturer.

---

## üö® Current Issues Identified

### 1. **Validation Error (Immediate Fix Needed)**
```
‚ùå Analysis failed: 1 validation error for CompetitorProfile
pricing_strategy
  Field required [type=missing, input_value={'name': 'Stryker Spine',...}, input_type=dict]
```
**Root Cause:** `CompetitorProfile` model requires `pricing_strategy` field but it's not being populated.

### 2. **Shallow Opportunity Areas**
- Brand opportunities: Generic, not competitor-specific
- Product opportunities: Limited to basic digital integration
- Pricing opportunities: One-size-fits-all approach
- Market opportunities: Superficial ASC focus

### 3. **Weak Search Query Strategy**
- **Too Generic:** "market opportunities 2024" yields broad results
- **Limited Scope:** Only 3-5 queries per competitor
- **Poor Targeting:** Doesn't leverage medical device industry specifics
- **No Layered Approach:** Single-pass research vs. iterative deep-dive
