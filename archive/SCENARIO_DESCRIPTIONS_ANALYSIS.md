---

## 🔍 **CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS**

### **Existing Scenario Selection UI**
```python
# Current implementation in streamlit_app.py (lines ~135-150)
st.subheader("🎯 Quick Demo Scenarios")

demo_scenarios = {
    "🫀 Cardiovascular Leaders": ["Medtronic", "Abbott", "Boston Scientific"],
    "🫀 Cardiovascular Innovation": ["Edwards Lifesciences", "Biotronik"],
    "🦴 Spine Fusion Leaders": ["Stryker Spine", "Zimmer Biomet"],
    "🦴 Spine Emerging Players": ["Orthofix", "NuVasive"],
    "🦵 Joint Replacement Giants": ["Stryker Ortho", "Smith+Nephew", "DePuy Synthes"],
    "🦵 Joint Innovation": ["Wright Medical", "Conformis"],
    "💉 Diabetes Care Leaders": ["Dexcom", "Abbott"],
    "💉 Diabetes Innovation": ["Medtronic Diabetes", "Tandem", "Insulet"]
}

selected_demo = st.selectbox("Choose demo scenario:", ["Custom"] + list(demo_scenarios.keys()))
```

### **Current User Experience**
1. User sees scenario names with emojis
2. User selects scenario (no context about what it represents)
3. Competitors auto-load
4. Category detection shows

### **Gap Identified**
- **No Context**: Users don't understand scenario differences
- **No Guidance**: No help choosing appropriate scenario
- **Missed Opportunity**: Could educate users about device categories

## 🎨 **UX DESIGN OPTIONS**

### **Option 1: Simple Description Text**
```python
# Add description below selectbox
if selected_demo != "Custom":
    st.caption(scenario_descriptions[selected_demo])
```

**Pros**: Simple, clean, minimal space usage  
**Cons**: Always visible, might clutter sidebar

### **Option 2: Expandable Help Section**
```python
# Add expandable section with all descriptions
with st.expander("ℹ️ Scenario Descriptions"):
    for scenario, description in scenario_descriptions.items():
        st.write(f"**{scenario}**: {description}")
```

**Pros**: Optional viewing, comprehensive overview  
**Cons**: Requires extra click, might be overlooked

### **Option 3: Tooltip-Style Help**
```python
# Add help parameter to selectbox
selected_demo = st.selectbox(
    "Choose demo scenario:", 
    ["Custom"] + list(demo_scenarios.keys()),
    help="Select a pre-configured scenario to analyze specific market segments"
)
```

**Pros**: Built-in Streamlit feature, clean  
**Cons**: Generic help, not scenario-specific

### **Option 4: Dynamic Description Display**
```python
# Show description for selected scenario only
selected_demo = st.selectbox("Choose demo scenario:", ["Custom"] + list(demo_scenarios.keys()))

if selected_demo != "Custom":
    st.info(f"📋 **{selected_demo}**: {scenario_descriptions[selected_demo]}")
```

**Pros**: Context-aware, prominent display  
**Cons**: Takes more space, changes layout dynamically

## 📝 **CONTENT STRATEGY**

### **Description Content Framework**
Each description should include:
1. **Market Focus**: What market segment this represents
2. **Company Types**: Why these specific competitors are grouped
3. **Use Case**: When a marketing professional would choose this scenario
4. **Expected Insights**: What type of analysis results to expect

### **Proposed Scenario Descriptions**

#### **Cardiovascular Scenarios**
```python
"🫀 Cardiovascular Leaders": "Analyze the dominant players in cardiovascular devices. These established companies lead in stents, pacemakers, and heart valves. Ideal for understanding market leadership strategies and competitive positioning in mature cardiovascular segments."

"🫀 Cardiovascular Innovation": "Focus on innovative cardiovascular companies driving next-generation technologies. These firms are advancing minimally invasive procedures and novel device designs. Perfect for identifying emerging trends and innovation opportunities."
```

#### **Spine Fusion Scenarios**
```python
"🦴 Spine Fusion Leaders": "Examine the top spine fusion device manufacturers. These industry giants dominate the spinal implant market with comprehensive product portfolios. Best for analyzing established market dynamics and competitive strategies."

"🦴 Spine Emerging Players": "Investigate growing companies in the spine fusion space. These firms are challenging established players with innovative approaches and specialized solutions. Ideal for spotting disruptive trends and market opportunities."
```

#### **Joint Replacement Scenarios**
```python
"🦵 Joint Replacement Giants": "Study the major orthopedic companies dominating hip and knee replacement markets. These established leaders have extensive surgeon networks and proven technologies. Perfect for understanding market leadership in large orthopedic segments."

"🦵 Joint Innovation": "Explore innovative joint replacement companies developing next-generation solutions. These firms focus on personalized implants and advanced materials. Great for identifying emerging technologies and market disruption opportunities."
```

#### **Diabetes Care Scenarios**
```python
"💉 Diabetes Care Leaders": "Analyze the leading continuous glucose monitoring and insulin delivery companies. These market leaders are setting standards for diabetes management technology. Ideal for understanding competitive dynamics in the growing diabetes tech market."

"💉 Diabetes Innovation": "Focus on companies advancing diabetes care through innovative technologies. These firms are developing next-generation insulin pumps and smart monitoring solutions. Perfect for spotting breakthrough technologies and market opportunities."
```

## 🏗️ **IMPLEMENTATION OPTIONS**

### **Recommended Approach: Option 4 (Dynamic Description)**

**Why This Option?**
- **Context-Aware**: Shows relevant information when needed
- **Prominent**: Users can't miss the description
- **Clean**: Only shows when scenario is selected
- **Professional**: Uses `st.info()` for polished appearance

### **Implementation Plan**

#### **Step 1: Create Description Dictionary**
```python
scenario_descriptions = {
    "🫀 Cardiovascular Leaders": "Analyze the dominant players in cardiovascular devices...",
    "🫀 Cardiovascular Innovation": "Focus on innovative cardiovascular companies...",
    # ... all 8 scenarios
}
```

#### **Step 2: Add Dynamic Display**
```python
# After scenario selection
if selected_demo != "Custom":
    st.info(f"📋 **About This Scenario**\n\n{scenario_descriptions[selected_demo]}")
```

#### **Step 3: Adjust Spacing**
```python
# Add some spacing for better visual hierarchy
if selected_demo != "Custom":
    st.info(f"📋 **About This Scenario**\n\n{scenario_descriptions[selected_demo]}")
    st.divider()  # Visual separation before competitor loading
```

## 📱 **MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS**

### **Considerations**
- **Sidebar Width**: Descriptions must fit in narrow sidebar
- **Text Length**: Keep descriptions concise for mobile viewing
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Ensure descriptions don't overwhelm on small screens

### **Mobile Optimization**
