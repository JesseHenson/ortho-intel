# Task 20 Completion Summary: Progressive Disclosure Frontend Integration

## 🎯 Overview
**Task 20: Update Progressive Disclosure Frontend Components** has been successfully completed, finalizing the comprehensive transparency system that transforms the orthopedic competitive intelligence platform from displaying demo data to real, credible source analysis.

## ✅ Major Accomplishment: Complete Transparency System

### Before (Demo Data Problem)
```
Tavily Search → Raw Results → Analysis → Fake Sources → Demo Data
```

### After (Complete Transparency)  
```
Tavily Search → Enhanced Metadata → Methodology Tracking → Real Source Integration → Progressive Disclosure with Complete Transparency
```
