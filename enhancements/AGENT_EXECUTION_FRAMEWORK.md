## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL GUARDRAILS

### Absolute Requirements (Never Violate)
1. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality must work unchanged
2. **Performance Limits**: Analysis time must stay within specified bounds
3. **Data Security**: Multi-tenant data must be completely isolated
4. **Test Coverage**: All new features must have comprehensive tests
5. **Rollback Capability**: Every change must be reversible

### Decision Framework
```python
# Use this framework for all implementation decisions:
class DecisionFramework:
    def evaluate_change(self, proposed_change):
        """Evaluate if a change should be implemented"""
        checks = [
            self.breaks_existing_functionality(proposed_change),
            self.exceeds_performance_limits(proposed_change),
            self.lacks_test_coverage(proposed_change),
            self.violates_security_requirements(proposed_change),
            self.outside_specification_scope(proposed_change)
        ]
        return not any(checks)  # Proceed only if all checks pass
```

### When to Stop and Ask for Guidance
- Any existing test fails after your changes
- Performance degrades beyond specified limits
- Implementation requires major architectural changes
- Security concerns arise during development
- Scope creep beyond specification requirements

## ðŸ§ª TESTING PROTOCOLS

### Required Testing Sequence
```bash
# Run after every significant change:

3. python tests/test_backward_compatibility.py # Existing features
4. python tests/test_performance.py            # Performance benchmarks
```

## ðŸ“š AGENT SUCCESS PATTERNS

### Proven Approaches
1. **Incremental Implementation**: Small, testable changes
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
3. **Feature Flags**: Enable gradual rollout and easy rollback
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous validation of system performance
5. **Documentation First**: Clear specifications before coding

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Scope Creep**: Adding features not in specifications
2. **Breaking Changes**: Modifying existing working functionality
3. **Performance Degradation**: Not monitoring system performance
4. **Security Oversights**: Inadequate multi-tenant isolation
5. **Testing Shortcuts**: Skipping comprehensive validation

### Emergency Procedures
If something goes wrong:
1. **Stop immediately** and assess the situation
2. **Run full test suite** to identify what broke
3. **Revert to last known good state** if necessary
4. **Document the issue** and lessons learned
5. **Ask for guidance** before proceeding

This framework provides the structure and guardrails needed to successfully implement the advanced features while maintaining the stability and quality of the existing platform.
