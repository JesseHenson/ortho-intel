# AGENT PREPARATION CHECKLIST
## Pre-Coding Requirements for Multi-Category Expansion

**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Context**: Preparing AI agent for safe, effective implementation of multi-category platform expansion  
**Risk Level**: Medium (extending working production system)

---

## CRITICAL PRE-CODING REQUIREMENTS

### 1. ENVIRONMENT SAFETY ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### 1.1 Backup Current Working State
```bash
# Create backup branch before any changes
git checkout -b backup-working-mvp-$(date +%Y%m%d)
git push origin backup-working-mvp-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Tag current working version
git tag -a v1.0-spine-mvp -m "Working spine fusion MVP before multi-category expansion"
git push origin v1.0-spine-mvp
```

**Why Critical**: We have a working, deployed MVP. Any mistakes could break production.

#### 1.2 Test Current System Baseline
```bash
# Verify current system works before changes
python test_integration.py
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

**Expected Results**: All spine fusion tests pass, analysis completes successfully.

#### 1.3 Environment Isolation
- [ ] Create new development branch: `feature/multi-category-expansion`
- [ ] Verify API keys are properly configured
- [ ] Confirm Streamlit Cloud deployment is stable
- [ ] Document current performance benchmarks

### 2. CODE ANALYSIS & UNDERSTANDING üîç

#### 2.1 Dependency Mapping
**Agent Must Understand**:
- How `data_models.py` affects `main_langgraph.py`
- Which files import `SearchTemplates` and `AnalysisProcessor`
- Impact of changing `GraphState` schema on existing pipeline
- Streamlit app dependencies on data model structure

#### 2.2 Critical Integration Points
```python
# Files that MUST remain compatible:
CRITICAL_FILES = [
    "main_langgraph.py",      # Core analysis pipeline
    "data_models.py",         # Data structures
    "streamlit_app.py",       # User interface
    "test_integration.py"     # Validation tests
]
```

#### 2.3 Existing Test Coverage Analysis
- [ ] Identify what's currently tested
- [ ] Map test gaps for new functionality
- [ ] Understand test data dependencies

### 3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS üöß

#### 3.1 Backward Compatibility Requirements
**MUST MAINTAIN**:
- Existing spine fusion analysis functionality
- Current API response format (add fields, don't remove)
- Streamlit demo scenarios for spine
- Test dataset compatibility

#### 3.2 Performance Constraints
- Analysis time must remain <5 minutes
- Memory usage should not increase significantly
- Category detection must be <1 second
- No breaking changes to LangGraph pipeline flow

#### 3.3 Error Handling Requirements
```python
# Required error handling patterns:
try:
    detected_category = CategoryRouter.detect_category(competitors, context)
except Exception as e:
    # MUST fallback to spine_fusion (known working)
    detected_category = "spine_fusion"
    log_error(f"Category detection failed: {e}")
```

### 4. VALIDATION FRAMEWORK üß™

#### 4.1 Test-Driven Development Setup
**Before Writing Code**:
1. Create test cases for category detection
2. Define expected cardiovascular analysis outputs
3. Set up A/B testing framework for quality comparison
4. Establish performance benchmarks

#### 4.2 Required Test Categories
```python
# Test structure agent must implement:
tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_category_detection.py     # Auto-detection accuracy
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_cardiovascular_analysis.py # End-to-end cardio testing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_search_templates.py       # Query quality validation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_backward_compatibility.py # Spine analysis still works
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_performance.py            # Speed/memory benchmarks
```

#### 4.3 Validation Data Requirements
- Known cardiovascular competitive landscape
- Expected clinical gaps for Medtronic/Abbott/Boston Scientific
- Benchmark spine analysis results for comparison
- Edge cases for category detection

### 5. INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY üìà

#### 5.1 Atomic Changes Only
**Agent Must**:
- Implement one component at a time
- Test each change before proceeding
- Maintain working system at each step
- Create checkpoint commits

#### 5.2 Implementation Order (Non-Negotiable)
```
1. Data models (DEVICE_CATEGORIES, CategoryRouter)
   ‚Üì Test category detection
2. Enhanced SearchTemplates 
   ‚Üì Test query generation
3. LangGraph pipeline updates
   ‚Üì Test end-to-end analysis
4. Frontend integration
   ‚Üì Test user experience
```

#### 5.3 Rollback Plan
- Each implementation step must be easily reversible
- Keep original code commented, don't delete
- Maintain feature flags for new functionality
- Document rollback procedures

### 6. QUALITY GATES üö™

#### 6.1 Code Quality Requirements
- [ ] Type hints for all new functions
- [ ] Docstrings following existing patterns
- [ ] Error handling for all external API calls
- [ ] Logging for debugging and monitoring

#### 6.2 Testing Gates
**Cannot Proceed Without**:
- [ ] All existing tests still pass
- [ ] New functionality has >80% test coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Manual testing of critical paths

#### 6.3 Integration Gates
- [ ] Spine fusion analysis quality unchanged
- [ ] Cardiovascular analysis produces reasonable results
- [ ] Category detection accuracy >90% on test cases
- [ ] Streamlit app loads and functions correctly

### 7. MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY üìä

#### 7.1 Required Logging
```python
# Agent must add logging for:
logger.info(f"Category detected: {category} for competitors: {competitors}")
logger.info(f"Search queries generated: {len(queries)} for category: {category}")
logger.warning(f"Category detection failed, using fallback: {fallback_category}")
logger.error(f"Analysis failed for category {category}: {error}")
```

#### 7.2 Performance Monitoring
- Track analysis completion times by category
- Monitor search query effectiveness
- Log category detection accuracy
- Alert on analysis failures

### 8. DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS üìö

#### 8.1 Code Documentation
- [ ] Update README with multi-category capabilities
- [ ] Document new environment variables/configuration
- [ ] Create category-specific usage examples
- [ ] Update API documentation

#### 8.2 Operational Documentation

## RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### High-Risk Areas
1. **LangGraph State Changes**: Modifying `GraphState` could break pipeline
2. **Search Template Changes**: Could degrade analysis quality
3. **Data Model Changes**: Could break frontend/API compatibility
4. **Performance Regression**: New category logic could slow analysis

### Mitigation Approaches
- **Gradual Rollout**: Test with single cardiovascular competitor first
- **Feature Flags**: Allow disabling new functionality if issues arise
- **A/B Testing**: Compare new vs old analysis quality
- **Canary Deployment**: Deploy to subset of users first

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Technical Success
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Cardiovascular analysis quality matches spine analysis
- [ ] Category detection >90% accurate
- [ ] Performance within acceptable limits

### Business Success
- [ ] Marketing firms can analyze cardiovascular competitors
- [ ] Analysis provides actionable competitive intelligence
- [ ] User experience remains smooth and intuitive
- [ ] Platform ready for additional category expansion

## CONCLUSION

This checklist ensures that any AI agent implementing the multi-category expansion does so safely, systematically, and with proper validation. The key principle is **"First, do no harm"** - we have a working system that must continue working while we add new capabilities.

**Agent Instruction**: Do not proceed with implementation until ALL items in the "Before Starting Implementation" checklist are completed. Each implementation step must pass its quality gates before proceeding to the next step.
